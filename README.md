# EZ AOSP

# PLEASE CONSIDER THIS ABANDONWARE!

### EZ AOSP is a simple automated and user input driven tool for Ubuntu Linux LTS 16.04+ for an easy setup of an AOSP (Android Open Source Project) build environment. It is entirely noob friendly and the code is written very simply so that users can understand, fork, edit, and contribute to it. ###

### NOTE: This is an automated tool. It is HIGHLY recommended that you learn how to setup a build environment manually. It's very easy and a guide for it can be found here: https://github.com/nathanchance/Android-Tools/blob/master/Guides/Building_AOSP.txt ###
